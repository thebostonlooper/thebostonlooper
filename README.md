Hi, I'm @thebostonlooper:

I'm currently working full time in sales for a startup handling our institutional client relationships. Previously, I have experience at a large Asset Management shop.

I'm interested in web development, particularly front end. 
The only programming experience I have dates back to a high school javascript course years ago.
I started by going through Harvard CS50 earlier in 2022, and I'm now underway with The Odin Project.
I'll be going through with the front end developer course for TOP and eventually setting up a basic website of my own.

Feel free to reach me at thebostonlooper@gmail.com
